## Geocomputation and Earth Observation (GECO)

We are a collection of researchers driven by our curiosity to understand how the terrestrial biosphere operates. We work at the intersection of Earth system science, ecophysiology, biogeochemistry, ecology, applied statistics, machine learning, and high-â€‹performance computing.

With our research we contribute to a better understanding of issues that are becoming increasingly pressing to society and policy and that are key to creating a sustainable future. Read more about our research.
